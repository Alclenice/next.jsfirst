__Hollow Knight__ is a 2017 Metroidvania video game developed and published by the Australian independent developer, Team Cherry. The player controls the Knight, an insectoid warrior exploring Hallownest, a fallen kingdom plagued by a supernatural disease.

Hollow Knight demands mastery of its systems; there is no button-mashing your way through the enemies, no moves you can spam over and over again to win, no bosses you can expect to beat on your first try. It's a brutally hard game and is not afraid to punish you for your mistakes.
